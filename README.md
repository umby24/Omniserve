# Omniserve

Omniserve is a universal, cross-platform, plugin based application server. 

The Omniserve core will provide universal methods that many applications will need, to ease development. You are of course welcomed to write your own within your application and use that instead.

These will include: Console + File logging, Task Scheduler, simple settings loader (key = value text file), and TCP networking.

## Plugins

Omniserve will accept plugins written in C, C++, as well as any other language that creates unmanaged libraries that can be loaded by the central server.

Structures will be written for Purebasic and C++ to be imported, and sample plugins will also be provided in both languages.

## Executables

Omniserve executables will be made available via Github's release feature once the core is stable.

### Info

Omniserve is written in Purebasic, a highly optmized cross-platform language. This keeps executables small, and execution super fast. This also allows the server to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Omniserve is tested and written on Windows, and will be tested on Linux before any release is made. If you would like to help test on Mac, please contact me.

### Contributing

If you have a plugin you would like to see added with the main application, make a pull request and provide samples for testing.

if you know and own purebasic, feel free to make a pull request as well if you find a more optimized way to do something, or find a bug in the application.

You can also contribute by simply submitting bug reports with as much detailed information on what caused the bug as possible.
